      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hi&#34;&gt;Hi&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wahrlich.github.io/images/genewahrlich.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A picture of Gene Wahrlich&#39;s mug&#34; title=&#34;gene wahrlich&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Gene. I head up the offensive security capability at Amazon. Specifically, in the Games, Media and Entertainment (GME) space. That means my day-to-day work involves managing offsec for some well-known products and businesses:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Prime Video&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Amazon MGM Studios&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Audible&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;IMDb&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twitch&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Amazon Game Studios&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before Amazon, I worked for offensive security consultancies MWR (Now WithSecure) and IOActive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the frontiers of cyber attack, having seen the progression from network to apps to cloud and now to identity itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-me-tell-you-a-story&#34;&gt;Let me tell you a story&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was working with a company that had a traditional approach to security. You know the type: a big firewall around the internal network, with the assumption that everything inside was safe and cozy. As long as you were “in the network,” you were trusted. They had one big Active Directory (AD) domain and everything could access everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That assumption came back to bite them. I was hired to do a pentest of some new APIs and I realised quickly that they were themselves talking to some other, older APIs that had been running the company&amp;rsquo;s core business for the past 20 years. Since I was inside the trust boundary, I could access the old APIs directly and bypass the authentication and authorisation enforced by the new APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;exploding-pagers&#34;&gt;Exploding pagers&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The news of Hezbollah agents being targeted with exploding pagers and UHF radios was a shock to us all. Whilst this type of attack was always a possibility in theory, seeing it occur in practice was perhaps the most visually horrific instance of a supply chain attack in recent history. This attack, along with the .mobi WHOIS debacle and the faulty Crowdstrike update, got me thinking quite a lot about supply chain attack surface. We all have these vulnerabilities, and there&amp;rsquo;s very little we can do in the way of mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
